# -O3 + -mcpu=native measured: race frame median 18.7 -> 15.7 ms
# (53.5 -> 63.9 fps).  Lifted code consists of many small basic blocks, more
# aggressive inlining/simplification pays off directly.
# DISTRIBUTION baseline:
#  -mcpu=apple-m1  : M1 is the common denominator of all Apple Silicon.  If built
#                    with "native", a binary produced on a newer Mac crashes on M1
#                    with an illegal instruction.  The measured difference on M1 is zero.
#  -mmacosx-version-min=11.0 : without the flag the binary is stamped with the
#                    building machine's OS version (minos 26.0) and on older macOS
#                    it never opens, saying "a newer version is required".

# DON'T PIPE the compiler output STRAIGHT into "| head -5": when head closed after
# 5 lines clang died of SIGPIPE while writing the next warning and the object file
# was NEVER written (shard_0006/0019: 3 times in 3 tries), and build.sh still
# returned 0 -> the link broke with "symbol(s) not found".  The output is first
# captured in a variable, then truncated; clang's exit code is kept (if any shard
# fails to compile, xargs and therefore build.sh return an error).
